Cuirass is continuous integration system using GNU Guix.  It is
intended as replacement for Hydra.

Requirements
============

GNU Guix must be installed along with all its development dependencies
as described here:

  https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Building-from-Git.html#Building-from-Git

Its modules must be found by Guile in '%load-path'.

Example
=======

A quick way to manually test Cuirass is to execute:

  ./pre-inst-env cuirass --specifications=tests/hello-singleton.scm --database=test.db

This will read the file "tests/hello-singleton.scm" which contains a list of
specifications and add them to the database "test.db" which is created if it
doesn't already exist.

cuirass then loops evaluating/building the specs.  The database keeps track of
the specifications in order to allow users to accumulate specifications.  To
resume the evaluation/build process you can execute the same command without
the specifications option:

  ./pre-inst-env cuirass --database=test.db
